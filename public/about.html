<h1>About Me</h1>
<P> After working in the space of optimizing campaigns for my clients whether it be on the SEO our PPC side of things,
 I never realized how much work goes into the development of a page every time we look at it. A deep and precise framework is imbedded
 throughout the entire site. Every text, image, and link moves with a purpose and within that purpose lies lines and lines of code.
 This sprung my interest in web development. How do they function? What makes WHAT function? Simply inspecting webpages and seeing how all the elements come together amazed me.
 So this is where it all begins.....</P>
